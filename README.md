## Welcome

Here, you find the JudaicaLink Ontology, i.e., the definitions of the properties and classes used in the [JudaicaLink](http://web.judaicalink.org) project.

You can contribute to the ontology by either raising an [issue](https://github.com/wisslab/judaicalink-ontology/issues) or creating a [pull request](https://github.com/wisslab/judaicalink-ontology/pulls).

Here is the ontology: [https://ontology.judaicalink.org/judaicalink-ontology](judaicalink-ontology)

You can also download the ontology in Turtle format: [http://ontology.judaicalink.org/judaicalink-ontology.ttl](judaicalink-ontology.ttl)
